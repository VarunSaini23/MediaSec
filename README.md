**SHARE CONTENT ON BLOCKCHAIN AND GET INCENTIVIZED**


**PROBLEM**
Original content is mis-credited or plagiarized. Social media personalities are building their brands using other peopleâ€™s work and generating income from it. No outlet for content creators to safely upload their original work to serve as the golden record.
Increasing plagrism is a major concern online! As a all the data that has been stored online is on a single server storage, privacy of the content provider is completely dependent on the server provider as there is no transperency on how or where the content is being used until searched for. This also increases the chance of manipulated content sharing.



**SOLUTION**
Incentivize content creators to share their original work by building a platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a unique transaction and golden record. This will generate profit sharing opportunities and proper crediting.

**HOW IT ALL WORKS**


**IPFS** *(Inter Planetary File System)* and **Ethereum** *Blockchain*
 
- IPFS removes duplications across the network and tracks version history for every file keeping Storage in control.
- Each network node stores only content it is interested in, and some indexing information that helps figure out who is storing what.
- Every file can be found by human-readable names using a decentralized naming system called IPNS.

IPFS and the Blockchain are a perfect match! You can address large amounts of data with IPFS, and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures your content, without having to put the data on the chain itself.
