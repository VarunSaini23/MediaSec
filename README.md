# MEDIASEC

**PROBLEM**
There is no platform where a content creator can post his original content without being worried of plagiarism or content theft issues.

The increase in plagiarism has become a very big issue now a days. As all the social media sites store the data online on a single server, the authenticity of the content and the privacy of content creator is at high risk. There is Zero transparency as the server provider has all the powers. They can sell his content without his permission, manipulate the content, make that content belong to some other powerful(influential) person by removing the original content creator.

Cases like these have happened before where the content creators are not credited for their own content.


**SOLUTION**
Creating a platform where a content creator can upload his content without any tension and get incetivized too. This dApp provides a platform that makes use of blockchain, so that the content becomes immutable and decentralized. Modifying any data is nearly impossible in Blockchain because the power is not in the hands of a single person. So, the content creator can also generate profits from his content.


**COMPLETE WORKING**

**Ethereum** *Blockchain* (*https://ethereum.org/en/*)

- Concept of blockchain was choosen because it makes the data immutable, decentralized and it maintains a distributed ledger.
- Ethereum Blockchain provides the concept of **SMART CONTRACTS** which is basically writing functions on blockchain to perform some tasks. Some common tasks include tipping a content creator, uploading content on blockchain etc.
- One problem was that, how to store content on blockchain because 1GB of data storage on blockchain costs around $76,000 *(according to a Yellow Paper)* , which is enormous. So to tackle this problem, IPFS is used.


**IPFS** *(Inter Planetary File System)*  (*https://ipfs.io/*)

- IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
- IPFS was utilised to store content.
- IPFS provides a URL after storing the data. Using that URL, the content can be retrieved. It also removes duplications, and tracks version of each file.
- So the URL recieved after storing data on IPFS was stored in the actual Ethereum blockchain. 
- In this way, we store the URL instead of the putting the whole data on blockchain.
